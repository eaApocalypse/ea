    "Epic Armageddon Tournament Rules",
    "The EA-Eternal War tournament game rules are designed to be used in conjunction with the EA-Eternal War army lists. They will allow two players to fight an evenly balanced battle with little or no preparation. They are ideal for pick-up games at clubs or shows, and provide an evenly balanced contest in tournaments. In many ways, tournament games represent the most ‘basic’ form of game play, and are designed to be as easy and accessible as possible in order to allow Epic players to play games with the minimum of fuss. Because of this, the tournament rules require little or no preparation other than picking forces from the army lists.",
    "Set Up",
    "The tournament table size is 120cm by 180cm (4 feet by 6 feet). The higher Strategy Rating may choose the table edge he sets up on. If both players have the same Strategy Rating, then dice to see who gets the choice of table edge. You can pick a long edge, or a corner (half way up each long and short edge). The opponent sets up on the opposite edge or corner.",
    "*See deployment examples on the main page.",
    "Pre-game discussion",
    "This is the time to discuss terrain with your opponent if the tables have not been giving a terrain card describing the table and basic layout. Work out with your opponent what things will be played as. Example, forests, hills, buildings ie. This is also the time to make new guys feel welcome or throw down your heaviest shit talk on veterans. Grab a drink and have fun.",
    "Place Objective Markers",
    "Take it in turns, starting with the player with the higher Strategy Rating, to place one objective marker on the table. If both players have the same Strategy Rating then dice to see who places the first objective marker.",
    "The first objective a player sets up must be placed on their own table edge 15cm from any corner. The remaining two objectives must be set up in their opponent’s half of the table, at least 30cm away from the opponent’s table edge, 30cm away from any other objectives that have already been placed and 15cm from any board edge.",
    "Keep placing objectives until six objective markers have been placed on the table in total. You can use anything as an objective marker but we would suggest using terrain pieces to represent them if you can. In our games, we’ve found that battling over an actual bunker or fuel dump is far more appealing than having your forces sell their lives for a cardboard counter!",
    "You capture an objective if you have a unit within 15cms of it in the end phase and your opponent does not. An objective is contested if both sides have a unit within 15cms of it in the end phase. Units from broken formations or from formations that have rallied that end phase cannot capture or contest objectives. Aircraft which have landed may not capture an objective on the same turn that it lands. However, a landed aircraft may immediately contest an objective.",
    "Check at the end of each turn to see how many objectives you control. Objectives do not have a ‘memory’ and you will lose control of any you have captured if there are no friendly units within 15cms of them at the end of any subsequent turn.",

    "",
    "Setup Spacecraft & Garrisons",
    "Each player may start up to two of their garrisoned formations on Overwatch. These formations represent sentries deployed as a trip wire and to provide security at the objectives. They are assumed to have gone on Overwatch in their previous Action phase. That Overwatch is ‘carried over’ into the first turn.",
    "If either player is using spacecraft then they are set up now before any other units (see 4.3). Units entering play via planetfall should be placed to one side at this time too (see 4.4).",
    "On-table garrison units are set up after spacecraft have been set up. The following types of formations may be set up on the table as ‘garrisons’ at the start of the game: ",
    "Formations where half or more of the units (rounding up) are scouts",
    "OR",
    "Formations where no more than one of the units has a move greater than 15cms, and where none of the units are war engines",
    "OR",
    "Any formations that include units with a speed of 0 (zero).",
    "",
    "Players take it in turns to set up one garrison at a time, starting with the player with the higher Strategy Rating. Garrisons must be set up so that they have at least one unit within 15cm of an objective in the player’s own half of the table. No units may be set up in the opponent’s half of the table or in impassable terrain. Units may be set up in dangerous terrain (it’s assumed that they took their time getting into position in order to do so safely!)",
    "Set-up Remaining Formations",
    "All of the remaining formations in the players’ armies must be set up within 15cms of their own side’s table edge or be kept back ‘in reserve’. The players take it in turn to set up these formations one at a time, starting with the player with the higher Strategy Rating.",
    "Units kept in reserve must either be aircraft, or be going to enter play in a transport aircraft or by teleportation. Reserve formations entering play in aircraft or by teleportation should be placed aside with units that will enter play via planetfall. These formations are not ‘secret’ and your opponent may inspect them at any time.",
    "Units being transported must start the game already loaded into the transport vehicle that will bring them into play (ie, an aircraft or unit with the planetfall ability).",
    "Formations entering play in aircraft or from spacecraft can do so on any turn, following the rules for transport aircraft and planetfall (see 4.2.5 & 4.4) Formations that are in reserve may not carry out any game functions or use special abilities they may have.",
    "",
    "Victory Conditions",
    "Objectives are ignored and only used for garrison purposes."
    "To achieve victory in this scenario, players need to destroy enemy units. At the end of turn 3 work out Victory Points scored as normally worked out in the Battle Line scenario.",
    "Work out the difference between each player and look up the chart below to work out the Battle Point score.",
    "Total Victory (32-0) (Victory Points are above 2500 points.)",
    "Major Victory (28-4) (Victory Points between 1500 and 2500 points.)",
    "Minor Victory (24-8) (Victory Points between 750 and 1499 points.)",
    "Winning Draw (20-12) (Victory Points between 200 and 749 points.)",
    "Complete Draw (16-16) (Victory Points less then 200 points.)"
