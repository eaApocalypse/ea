Although you can only take a troupe formation if you first take a warhost, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together. The third types of formation are Exodite Maiden World support, allies & massive creatures. A maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.",
