    "The first major such cult encountered by the Imperium, the Cult of the Four-Armed Emperor appeared on Ghosar Quintus in 680.M41 by quietly taking over the planet's ruling Trysst Dynasty. The Cult was ultimately thought eliminated by a Deathwatch Kill-Team led by Ortan Cassius.",
    "However the truth is far more disturbing, for before the arrival of the Deathwatch on Ghosar Quintus the Cult of the Four-Armed Emperor had its members infiltrate work groups which were then shipped across the galaxy by the Departmento Munitorum. The corrupted Trysst dynasty has endured, and the Cult of the Four-Armed Emperor now exists across many worlds in Ultima Segmentum. The Cult has come to specialize in mining, burrowing, and subterranean exploration and in war are known for their ambush, demolition, and mining tactics. They are one of the few Genestealer cults that plan to spread on a galactic level as opposed to merely planetary.",
    "The heraldry of the Cult of the Four-Armed Emperor celebrates the industrial symbols of the Trysst Dynasty despite their forefathers having long since been slain by the Deathwatch. The many infestations across Ultima Segmentum use variations of the same colors.",
    "To build a Genestealer army based on the Cult of the Four Armed Emperor, you need to first need to add a Patriarch Host, this formation must be taken and always counts as your BTS, even if its not the most expensive formation in the army. You can then choose from the formations listed below. For each Cult Brood formation you take you can take 2 Cult support formations. Each of these formations have upgrades. Upgrades are also listed below, you may only add upgrades if the formations are listed with the upgrade option. Genestealer armies may also take Cult Navy formation. These may be added but must not exceed 1/3 of the points of the army."
