          "Some units are noted as being able to call in coordinated fire. These units can order up to two other formations within 15cm that have not taken an action this turn, and which are not broken, to follow their own formation when they take an advance, double or sustained fire action.",
          "Make a single Initiative roll for all formations, counting a single -1 modifier if any have Blast Markers. If the test is failed then the original formation (containing the unit calling for coordinated fire) receives a Blast Marker and must take a hold action, but the other formations are unaffected (and may take an action later in the turn). If the test is passed then all formations concerned are allowed to take either an advance, double or sustained fire action.",
          "There is no obligation for all formations to take the same action, and these actions may be resolved in any order, but they must all fire at the same target formation. The formations donâ€™t have to stay within a given distance of each other and will complete their actions one after the other. Each formations action is declared and resolved (including testing to see if the target formation is broken) before moving on to the next Tau formation.",
          "Note that units with this ability confer the coordinated fire ability to any formation that they join. For example, a Pathfinder upgrade purchased to be added to a Fire Warrior Cadre, adds the coordinated fire ability to all units in the Cadre.",
          "There are no requirements with regards which action from sustain, advance or double a formation takes.",
          "If an action with a movement component is chosen there are no specific movement restrictions. You may move as normal in any allowed direction or manner. You don't have to move towards the coordinated fire target or even make any attempt to get any weapons in range if you don't want to.",
          "The only requirement is that if you choose to shoot it must be at the formation picked as the target of the coordinated fire.",
          "The target of the coordinated fire being destroyed or moving to a position where it cannot be shot has no impact on any movement component of the action chosen. It just means that you will not be able to shoot."

So if a unit with a guided missile weapon is in range and has LOF to a unit in the target formation then it is counted for suppression purposes. It is counted even if it cannot fire because for instance - the target is not marked, or an aircraft (note: unless landed, aircraft never count as marked).",
